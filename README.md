Hi, this is my first year programming coursework. 
The course is written in C++ using QTCreator for the graphical interface using html markup and css styles.

The purpose of the coursework was to write software for an IT company. 
It was necessary to implement the functionality of authorization, addition/deletion of employees, projects and project delegation among employees. 
The functionality of creating groups to work on one project was also created.

Detailed information about the coursework along with screenshots of the program can be viewed in the pdf file.
